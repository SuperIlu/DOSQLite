# DOSQLite
This is a DOS/32 build of the command line tool for [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) based on v3.46.1.
[sqlite-amalgamation-3460100](https://www.sqlite.org/2024/sqlite-amalgamation-3460100.zip).

It was built using DJGPP like my other projects [DOjS](https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjS) and [jSH](https://github.com/SuperIlu/jSH), using the same compiler flags and the patches to `sqlite3.c` as over there.

A non virtual memory version of [CWSDPMI](http://sandmann.dotster.com/cwsdpmi/) is included.
